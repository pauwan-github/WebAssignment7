Unit Testing and Integration Testing
	Unit Testing - This involves testing individual components or functions of your code in isolation. The goal is to ensure that each part works correctly on its own. 
	Integration Testing - This testing phase assesses how different components of the application work together. It ensures that integrated modules function as expected when combined. 
Importance of Testing
•	Functionality - Testing ensures that the application meets the specified requirements and behaves as expected. 
•	Reliability - Well-tested applications are less likely to have bugs, which increases user trust and satisfaction. 
•	Performance - Testing can identify performance issues before deployment, ensuring the application runs efficiently under various conditions.  
Debugging Techniques
Frontend Debugging  
Chrome DevTools to inspect elements, view console logs, and debug JavaScript errors. Check network requests to ensure the frontend interacts correctly with the backend.  
Backend Debugging
	Logging in to track application flow and catch errors. 
	Utilizing debugging tools like the VS Code debugger to set breakpoints and step through the code. Implementing error handling to manage exceptions gracefully and log relevant information.  
Practice Debugging Common Issues 
•	Syntax Errors - Check your code for typos or missing punctuation. 
•	Runtime Errors - Use console logs to identify where in your code the error occurs and what variables might be causing issues.
•	Logical Errors - Use test cases to ensure your code behaves as expected; revise your logic if it doesn’t.
